Hello this video is going to be shared with the developer as well as the tester and this will be covering the complete requirement and the UI, the UX of the complete mobile app.
01:54
All right, so we'll start with the first screen.
01:58
This is the splash screen, which will have the logo as toast and the tag as inspire to connect.
02:10
The user will be.
02:12
Logged in.
02:14
Using LinkedIn.
02:18
Asda authentication mechanism.
02:21
Sign up will also happen using the same methodology.
02:27
When the first time the user logs in, he will be.
02:34
Auto populated with some data like name, e-mail, ID.
02:41
Company.
02:41
He's working with location.
02:49
Yeah and all these will be edited later, but whatever I said now will be auto populated from LinkedIn.
02:58
Right, I repeat, it is the name, e-mail ID, the company name and the city will be auto populated.
03:06
The moment he signs up, alright, so when he signs up.
03:14
Probably.
03:17
You know we can start with edit profile page so that he can fill up this before he could move on.
03:27
So a new person signs up.
03:31
It automatically goes to the edit profile with auto loaded picture, name, e-mail ID, company and location.
03:42
These two fields will be left out empty for him to edit.
03:48
Alright, and name will be Asper LinkedIn so this should not be editable.
03:55
That is a verification will be done.
03:57
So this should not be editable nor the e-mail ID.
04:01
So e-mail ID is already grayed out.
04:03
This should also grayed out and it should auto populate from LinkedIn.
04:08
Only company can be editable but it auto populates from LinkedIn.
04:12
Location can be editable but it auto populates from Langdon this both are going to be blank for the end user.
04:22
You.
04:23
Yeah to fill in the data.
04:25
So when I say these two, the club name and the communication e-mail will be added by the user and after that he clicks on.
04:36
Save changes.
04:38
The moment he clicks on save changes it navigates to this particular profile page.
04:46
This is where the profile is viewed and this shows the profile pic, name, e-mail, ID.
04:56
Company name, location, Club name, payment status, mentor name, date, joint role, last speech delivered, communication, e-mail.
05:09
At first place the user will not have all the data.
05:15
Alright, because he has not officially joined any club.
05:20
So when I say officially is not joined, when he types in the club name, there will be an approval which will be sent to the club president to approve his presence.
05:36
So that is why there is a red mark scene over here.
05:40
The red mark means that it is not approved.
05:44
A green mark means that it is approved.
05:47
So after the approval, probably other data will be updated by the President.
05:54
So these data need not be updated by the the person, all right?So once the profile is updated.
06:08
Again.
06:10
See the home page, right?The home page will have, uh, the notifications, announcements and communications that are sent by the President.
06:27
And other members of the club.
06:30
This is something like a Facebook approach but I mean I don't.
06:35
But we are not looking for a complete features, we are going to have the messages.
06:44
Ohh Sean one below the other like in Facebook right? And each message will have three buttons, one is like another one is comment and third one is clap.
07:02
Uh, each message will also give the information about the user like his profile picture and the role that he plays in the club and which club he belongs to, including the date that this poster was posted, right? There are three messages you will see in this design.
07:23
This is to tell you that there could be three different types of messages or announcement or communication that will be.
07:32
Sent across the club members, so one would be of a simple message where a user only uses text.
07:44
The other type would be of an image as well as a text.
07:51
Right.
07:52
And the third type will be of multiple images with text.
07:58
Right.
07:59
So that's all been given as per the design and it should be as per the design.
08:05
All right.
08:05
And here this in this particular message or the post there is a comment that has been done.
08:14
The comment will be looking like this with the profile pic and his name with the time.
08:22
There won't be any like or reply on top of this as seen on Facebook.
08:29
That's intentional.
08:31
So, uh, anybody who wants to comment, of course can comment, but there wouldn't be like a share or a or anything else for a comment.
08:43
All right, that's is the.
08:45
This will be the home page and you see that there are three buttons on top.
08:51
These are the scope of the message.
08:55
When I click club, the message will be specific to the club that I belong to.
09:03
When I click area, the messages related to that area will be shown when I click district.
09:11
Messages related to that specific district will be shown.
09:18
All right.
09:19
And if any announcements are to be done, the Member cannot do it.
09:25
So as a Member this is not possible.
09:28
This should be grayed out.
09:30
OK, we will specifically talk about the other persona who is a person President persona in a different recording, but for now this will be disabled and he cannot send any announcement or messages.
09:47
You can only view comment clap like.
09:52
All right.
09:53
Also when he clicks on this profile, of course it goes to the profile of the other person on which he will be.
10:05
Able to see this specific details that I talked.
10:09
So this specific details he will be able to see when he clicks on the.
10:18
Uh, that the user pick of the message.
10:23
Alright, so that's about the home page.
10:26
So home page is all about.
10:30
Communication, announcements, interaction.
10:35
Right now we will talk about the.
10:43
Notifications.
10:46
Notifications are.
10:51
Or or something that are that are done.
10:55
Uh, specifically to a club or specifically those announcements that are?Targeted to this person, to this Member, then those will appear on the notification.
11:11
A precedent can tag a user, right? So in such case the notification will appear here in some cases, let's say there is an event that is going to happen, so the app itself will notify stating that hey, you have an event tomorrow or after tomorrow, whatever.
11:29
Also notification will happen the moment the new user signs in.
11:36
Saying that your profile has to be approved.
11:39
That also comes as a notification.
11:41
So notification are going to be any messages that are.
11:48
Very important.
11:50
To be seen that by that person, either from the app or from other clubs, or from his own president.
11:59
Right.
11:59
It could be anywhere.
12:00
Um, so.
12:03
We will be speaking.
12:06
About what gets notified.
12:09
At every other screens, so I don't want to bring in the details about when to notify exactly when.
12:22
So I will be speaking as I move on so notification screen will look like this.
12:28
Whenever a notification is there, there is going to be a blue dot on top of this bell and those notifications that are read will be.
12:39
Have a white background around it, whereas the notification that are unread will have a white background as shown in this image.
12:49
Every notification will have of course a time and source.
12:55
Right, so when you click on this particular notification.
13:00
There is no.
13:03
Now window opens up because every notification will be 2 liner at the Max.
13:10
Right.
13:12
Moving on, we'll talk about the timeline.
13:16
So this timeline is equivalent to a Facebook timeline, so you can exactly map to it.
13:26
Whatever the major actions that is done.
13:30
Will be recorded in the timeline.
13:33
What to what actions to be considered considered as a major timeline will be shared with you.
13:40
For now you will be building this specific screen and process behind it, but what will go in will be shared later so that whenever that specific event occurs, that event will send an API to this particular table to update it.
14:03
Right.
14:04
And in this screen.
14:07
The user will be able to navigate between the months.
14:12
As well as the year.
14:14
So if he wants to move towards a July, he's going to click on July, he if he wants to, you know, check out December, he's going to use this crawler to see the December month and he's gonna look at the look at the timelines, right?Apart from that, yes this is scrollable, so it's not that you know you only can see the node timelines by clicking on this month, but.
14:47
Of course the timelines can be scrollable to the complete year.
14:53
So if I say 2022 the all the events of 2022 will be loaded.
14:59
OK.
15:00
Uh, so the year, how the year will look like is also shown over here?Right.
15:07
I would appreciate if there is a option called all that is added it is missed out.
15:15
Please Add all in this design so that if I click on all I should be able to see all the timelines of any given year any month.
15:27
Should be completely visible on the screen.
15:30
And yes, of course it is scrollable.
15:33
All right.
15:35
That's about timeline.
15:39
Now ohh I I forgot to explain about this home page in the home page.
15:48
If there are no messages or announcement, this is going to be the page that is going to look like.
15:54
So I just want to show you that hey, this is the kind of a picture you will be using and this is how it will be looking if it is empty, yeah.
16:03
Finally, I think we're going to talk about dashboard.
16:07
This is the final screen I believe.
16:11
Let me check if I missed anything.
16:14
Yeah, this is the final screen.
16:16
So this dashboard is going to be the going to talk about some of the major achievements of the user.
16:25
So I'll be talking about 1 by 1. So first one is the attendance part.
16:27
So as the member attends a specific meeting, he will be marked for that specific attendance. We will talk about that attendance part later, but as he attends the meeting.
16:44
He gets the green green colored meeting number over here and if he's not attending the meeting it will be red color.
16:56
If the meeting has not started yet, it will be in black color here as well.
17:03
Scrawling is possible in both ways.
17:07
One is day wise crawling is there or meeting wise crawling.
17:11
The other one is month wise crawling.
17:14
Also has year, so this will I can change whichever year I want to go and see the data all right.
17:25
The second one is a comparison attendance record where it compares what is the total percentage of attendance that this specific user has compared to others.
17:39
So when you say others, so others will be the aggregate of all the employees except this person.
17:49
So all the other employees will be taken and it will be aggregated to show the exact percentage.
17:56
Um, so this will be a moving, I don't know, we'll call it as a nozzle.
18:06
The nozzle will keep moving based on the percentage and.
18:11
Now it tells you where exactly you are as well.
18:16
Right.
18:17
Uh.
18:18
That's about it.
18:19
And this also has uh uh, you know, uh.
18:25
Different tenures like shown here, I can see the overall attendance for three months, six months, one year, two year, three-year and all right, all in the sense it includes all the data in the previous X years.
18:41
It could be even 10 years, doesn't matter.
18:44
So the filter or you can call it as a filter or you can call it as the.
18:52
The criteria is 3 months, six months, one year, two year or three-year or all the years. These are the filters we will have for the meeting attendance. Now coming down to the next dashboard is the pathways. The pathways will have the name of the path, that's what is the name of the path and.
19:18
What level the user is in? So level here.
19:22
In this case the user is in level one and then it tells what project he is in.
19:27
In this case the user is in Project 2, so based on that the green point will be placed.
19:36
So in this example.
19:37
In this particular example it is incorrectly placed.
19:41
This green has to be placed over.
19:45
Here because it is level one and project 2 so it has to be matching the coordinates exactly and it should sit at the right place and the circle.
20:01
The filled in circle that you see here, you will notice that it is.
20:08
It is smaller.
20:11
And you will also see something or bigger something are very big and that could be that could be chances that this could even grow much more bigger, right? This is based on the.
20:24
Data that is coming from other people, other employees, other employees could have been also finished the levels.
20:32
So let's say if out of 100 employees, 90 employees are probably we'll talk about 50 employees are finished, you know, Level 4, sorry, Level 2 and Project 4 let's say.
20:51
So in such case the circle will become very big.
20:54
Which means 50 people have completed and if in case this user is part of this 50 then this complete circle will become green in color which means that that specific user is at this level and it also notifies that around 50 people.
21:15
All right, around this, many people are.
21:21
Are also at the same level.
21:23
So how do I know that this circle is denoting 50 people, right? So that's exactly where the tool tip comes in place.
21:33
The tool tip is not shown over here, but this is exactly where the tool tip comes in place to show whenever the.
21:47
You know, kind of click on that specific chart, we get the numbers.
21:56
Or I think if possible, if you could show the numbers on top of it, that would be great without.
22:06
Yeah.
22:08
Without clashing each other, then that will be great.
22:11
It will be a very small tool tip and shown on each and every bubble.
22:16
At the Max there will be 8 bubbles.
22:20
I'm guessing that there won't be too many bubbles because it's only comes the bubbles comes at the intersection and I'm sure it doesn't clash with other bubble at any point.
22:32
Right until it is too big in such case of course.
22:37
We can even make it smaller based on the data.
22:43
We can do some mathematical control over there.
22:47
That is surely possible.
22:48
So yes, pathways.
22:50
These bubbles will have a tool tip for all.
22:54
I think you can make it as a default.
22:56
And there is a filter which says club level, area level and district level.
23:03
That's about this graph and we will talk about the points.
23:08
The points are something like a reward points the user is going to get and it all has a graph.
23:16
If you would have guessed it by now this.
23:22
The the line that is moving on top of this blue filled in graph.
23:29
Uh is all about the maximum points that others would have got.
23:34
Let's say out of 100 employee, one employee is at the top.
23:38
Top maximum point and that data will be shown over here.
23:44
It of course takes only one employee.
23:48
It doesn't give the mix of employees it takes at any given point, it only takes a top user.
23:57
OK, so let's say in three months, who is the top that data comes in over here? If I say six months, who is the top, that data comes over here, right?And similarly the data flows in for this specific user with a filled in graph, right? We also have filter for three months, six months, one year, two year, three-year and all years.
24:25
The month will of course will change based on the.
24:31
The the the criteria that you choose, uh, when it is one year.
24:35
Of course, you need to make sure the graph looks neat and presentable at the same time.
24:41
It shows the data that we are looking for, right?And nobody's gonna zoom into these data.
24:48
These are not something you know, connected to market or something where he needs to drill down and look into details not require.
24:57
It is just a performance data.
24:59
So we don't have to zoom in or zoom out or something, just give the filters.
25:05
That should be enough for now.
25:07
And then followed by rewards, the rewards will be added.
25:12
So when a person starts, of course there will be no rewards, it will be empty.
25:20
Then we can just say no rewards or something like that, and this is of course callable.
25:28
Finally, the roles volunteered is that is a data that tells us how many times a user has been taken a specific role like a speaker or an air counter or a timer, whatever, right? This talks about just the data.
25:46
This is nothing to do with any there's no comparison as such.
25:52
Yeah, that's about it.
25:55
And did I missed anything?OK, so I have covered all the data for this requirement.
26:07
If you have any question please post it before you start your work so that it becomes easier and it is convenient for both of us.
